# GardenGuru Project
 
This project was made with HTML and CSS, to practice forms and responsive design. The project contains a login and a sign up page, with options to sign in with Google and Facebook and a "forgot password" option (buttons with no function). The idea of the project is to create a minimalistic and monocromatic layout that follows the purpose of the app.
